  \item
    This Fund exists to provide financial support for Active and Prospective Members of the Gamma Chapter to attend National and District Conventions.
  \item
    A percentage of all profits from Chapter fundraising projects shall be contributed to the Convention Fund.
  
  \item
    The Executive Council will determine said percentage and present the determined amount to the Chapter for approval no later than five (5) weeks before the start of the given convention.

  \item
    Funding shall be divided equally among all members attending the given Convention and shall be allocated in the following priority:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
      \item Registration
      \item Hotel
      \item Travel Costs
    \end{enumerate}
    A member may decline all or part of his or her disbursement if they so choose, in which case all declined money shall be evenly distributed among all others receiving money.
    The decision to decline must be made and presented to the Treasurer by the first Chapter Meeting after Convention.
  
  \item
    Any dispersal of the Convention Fund requires a majority vote of the Chapter.

    Disbursement of the Convention Fund shall occur no later than the Chapter meeting following Convention; however, extenuating circumstances may be dealt with on an individual case-by-case basis by the Executive Council.
