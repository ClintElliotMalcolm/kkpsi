This repository exists to to facilitate collaborative work on our constitution.

Git has a number of features that make it will suited to seeing changes between versions, keeping a history of all changes that have happen to a document, and having many people concurrently work on a document.
However, ordinary .doc or .docx files are not easily able to be used by git, so the files are in a different file format.
While this may seem disadvantageous, it is actually a great boon as latex, the format used here is actually better in many aspects.
